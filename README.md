# MatrixNormalShrinkFlop
Fast shrinkage based estimator for matrix normal covariance

## Usage 

FlipFlop.R contains the algorithm for the estimator, which is called regsinkhorn. Based on forthcoming work joint with Akshay Ramachandran, Rafael Oliveira, and Michael Walter.

The file ShrinkFlop.rmd compares this algorithm with other estimators such as KGlasso and Gemini in various generative models.
